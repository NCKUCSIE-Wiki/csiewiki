Know issues and TODOs
=====================

- The `wiki` executable is very, very coarse. No error checking, no memory. It also kills all gitit process when running `./wiki stop`.
- Some of the interface is not prosented in the templates.
	It should be translated in the source code for convenient, or modify the source to let all the UI consist in the templates.
	(Does anyone familiar with Haskell? orz)
